# 2D Convolution

## What this does.

This package takes black and white image as an input and returns the same image with features (horizontal or vertical) as an output. 

Essentially, it means that after transformation, there will be left only horizontal or vertical (based on the parameter provided) lines on the picture.

Convolutional Neural Networks (`CNNs`) make use of these "feature highlighted" images to predict what is on the picture.
